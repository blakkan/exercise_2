How I made the plot.

First, after running the application, I used a utility script I had written to generate
a csv file with the 20 most freqent words and their counts

$python ../top20tocsv.py > words.csv


As part of my development environment, I mount my EC2 instance's file system on my
local ubuntu machine, which has R installed.  On that machine I run

$r makeplot.r < words.csv



This produces Plot.png.

I inclue makeplot.r for reference in the github repo, but it is NOT intended to be
run in the AMI.
